# Connect-Four
Connect Four - State Space Search - CustomAi vs NaiveAi

(To run this program you will need to install Racket on your computer first.) 
1. Please download all the files into a folder, the program will open by running connect-four-naive.exe. 

2. Once it opens select RUN at the top right. 

3. The connect four GUI will pop-up, go to EDIT --> PREFERENCS
  
GRID
I used the default grid size of WIDTH: 7, HEIGHT 6, CELL SIZE: 72 when conducting the analysis of my ai against the naive ai.

4. Within preferences, change EXECUTABLE path for PLAYER 1 PROGRAM to wherever you have your Python interpreter is installed.

5. Change the ARGUMENTS for PLAYER 1 PROGRAM to the downloaded file 'connect-four-miller.py'

6. By deafult PLAYER 2 PROGRAM EXECUTABLE path should be set to 'C:\Program Files\Racket\Racket.exe' and ARGUMENTS should be set to 'connect-four-naive.rkt' If this is not the case, please ensure they are set to these.

7. Click RUN and the game should start on its own.

8. After the game ends, you can press RUN to replay the game with the same settings. If at anytime you exit the 'Connect Four' GUI then you will have to repeat steps [3 - 7]
